# SparkFun Weather Shield
DEV-12081

# Description: 
The Weather Shield is an easy to use Arduino shield that grants you access to barometric pressure, relative humidity, luminosity and temperature. There are also connections on this shield to optional sensors such as wind speed, direction, rain gauge and GPS for location and super accurate timing.

These Weather Shields utilize the HTU21D humidity, MPL3115A2 barometric pressure, and ALS-PT19 light sensors and relies on the HTU21D and MPL3115A2 Arduino libraries. Each shield comes with two unpopulated RJ11 connector spaces (for optional hook up of rain and wind sensors) and a 6-pin GPS connector (for optional hook up of a GP635T GPS module). Finally, each Weather Shield can operate from 3.3V up to 16V and has built in voltage regulators and signal translators.

# Notes
The Weather Shield comes as a stand-alone board. Headers, connectors, and additional sensors will need to be purchased separately, check the related items or wish list below!

This shield was designed for the SparkFun Redboard and Arduino Uno and will not work with other boards (like the Arduino Yun, for example) without modification.
